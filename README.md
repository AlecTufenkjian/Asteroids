# Asteroids - Cegep Project

This is my recreation of the famous/old game Asteroids. Please [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mjVo3phKooDyxz-Z-4Nujob_Diypqz97/view?usp=sharing) to watch me play it. 

I had a lot of fun working on this game with my classmate. It solidified my understanding of Java objects, inhertance, interfaces, as well as the concept of game loops. While the slick2D library is outdated, it allowed me to learn Java OOP visually, which i'm very thankful for.

This game is dependant of the Slick2D library. To run this game, you have to add the path of the library in project configurations.
